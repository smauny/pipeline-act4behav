<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This GitHub repository contains a set of Python scripts presented in X to automatically pre-process data and train classification models to detect animal behaviours from accelerometer data. A set of example data is available on: https://doi.org/10.57745/LGZBM1 and is presented in the following datapaper (in prep).

This README file provides a step by step guide on how to use this pipeline.

### Reference
* <a href="https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.12624785"><img src="https://zenodo.org/badge/787314370.svg" alt="DOI"></a>

### Built With
* [![Python][Python.js]][Python-url]

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
### Prerequisites

* Python packages
  ```sh
  pip install numpy pandas plotly glob2 scikit-learn catboost seaborn matplotlib tsfresh
  ```

### Installation

Clone the repo in your working folder
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/pipeline-act4behav.git
   ```

### Available data

You can download example data on: https://doi.org/10.57745/LGZBM1 
This data is presented in our datapaper (in prep).

Save the raw data in a folder in the pipeline-act4behav folder.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage
### Basic run 
In your terminal, you can start by running the scripts_pipeline.py file

   ```sh
   python3 /your/working/directory/scripts/scripts_pipeline.py
   ```


Several questions will be asked. You can answer the questions one by one by following the instructions in the parenthesis and click enter to answer the next question

- **What is the name of the data folder?** Enter the name of the folder in your working directory where your raw data is located.
- **Do you want to filter the data?** Enter yes or no to apply a high-pass filter on the raw acceleration data.
- **What type of reference vector computation do you want? (median/mean/blank)** Enter the name of the transformation you want to apply to your data. This will create an additional time-serie in your dataset.
- **What is the cutoff frequency (X.x Hz/blank)?** If you entered 'yes' for the data filter, enter the value of the cutoff frequency.
- **What is the frequency measurement (X.x Hz)?** Enter the sampling rate of the accelerometer data in Hertz.
- **What is the size of the time windows (s)?** Enter the size of the time-windows you want to use in seconds to segmentate the data
- **Do you want to include Euler angles? (yes/no)** Enter yes or no if you want to include or not the pitch and roll time-series calculated from your data/
- **How many of the best features do you want to select (x/blank)** Enter the number of the best features you want to keep (features selection)
- **First behavior to predict?
Second behavior to predict?
Third behavior to predict?
Fourth behavior to predict?** Enter the names of the behaviours you want to detect. The names should be the same as in your data.

### Multiple runs
If you want to execute multiple runs automatically, you can open and modify the control_script_pipeline.py script instead of the scripts_pipeline.py. Enter directly the parameters you want to choose for your runs. In this example, multiple time-windows sized are tested (10, 20, 30 and 40 seconds)

   ```sh
   pipeline_runs = [
    {"id_expe": "adapt", "filter": "no", "reference_vector_computation": "mean", "cutoff_hz": "", "freq_measure": "5", "time_windows": "10", "euler_angles": "yes", "features_selection": "", "behavior1": "ruminating", "behavior2": "feeder", "behavior3": "standing", "behavior4": "lying"},
    {"id_expe": "adapt", "filter": "no", "reference_vector_computation": "mean", "cutoff_hz": "", "freq_measure": "5", "time_windows": "20", "euler_angles": "yes", "features_selection": "", "behavior1": "ruminating", "behavior2": "feeder", "behavior3": "standing", "behavior4": "lying"},
    {"id_expe": "adapt", "filter": "no", "reference_vector_computation": "mean", "cutoff_hz": "", "freq_measure": "5", "time_windows": "30", "euler_angles": "yes", "features_selection": "", "behavior1": "ruminating", "behavior2": "feeder", "behavior3": "standing", "behavior4": "lying"},
    {"id_expe": "adapt", "filter": "no", "reference_vector_computation": "mean", "cutoff_hz": "", "freq_measure": "5", "time_windows": "40", "euler_angles": "yes", "features_selection": "", "behavior1": "ruminating", "behavior2": "feeder", "behavior3": "standing", "behavior4": "lying"}
]
   ```
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

Save the code and run the control_script_pipeline.py instead of the scripts_pipeline.py

   ```sh
   python3 /your/working/directory/scripts/control_script_pipeline.py
   ```
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Output
#### 1. You provided training data (acceleration data + associated behaviours) 
The pipeline pre-processes your data and trains four models for the behaviours that you chose.
The pipeline creates in output the pre-processed data in a .csv file in the folder "pre-processed data".
The pipeline creates in output in the folder "scores_features_models" (automatically created in your working directory):
- the scores of the trained models in .csv files
- the trained models in .cbm files
- the features importances of each model on .csv files
- the features selected for each model (depending on the features selection parameter applied) on .txt files

#### 2. You provided acceleration data 
The pipeline pre-processes your data and detects automatically that you don't want to train models. 
The pipeline creates in output the pre-processed data in a .csv file in the folder "pre-processed data".
